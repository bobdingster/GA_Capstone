# Recipe Recommender System
Inspired by my daughter's love for [cooking and baking](https://paintpencilpastries.com/), I decided to build a recipe recommender system to fulfill my graduation requirement from General Assembly.


**Machine Learning Problems**:
1. Given certain ingredients, such as things I have in the fridge, could I find some recipes or some suggestions about what to cook?

2. Given a personâ€™s preferences of one recipe, could I recommend other recipes they might enjoy?

3. Can I categorize the recipes? Given a certain recipe, can I find other recipes that fall in same categories?

The motivation behind this recommendation system is to help users discover personalized and new recipes, and prepare for grocery runs.

# Models


1. Classifications - Use Naive Bayes and Gradient Boost Models to predict ratings from review text--- `03_Ratings_Classifier.ipynb`

> If I found one user wrote in the review  "So simple, so delicious! Great",  the model can predict which rating the user would give.

2. Matching - Use Numpy and Pandas to create search functions which would find recipes with the best ingredient matches. --- `04_Ingredient_match.ipynb`

> If I have winter squash, Mexican seasoning, mixed spice and honey in the fridge, the model can give some recipes on what to cook with these ingredients

3. Collaborative Filtering - Suggest recipes that other users similar to you also liked (Cosine Similarity) --- `05_User_Collaborative.ipynb`

> If I liked *Oven fried chicken*, and another user similar to me liked *The Texas bbq rub* and I haven't tried it, the model would recommend that recipe.

4. Content Based Filtering - Suggest recipes that are similar to recipes that you like (LDA model similarities) --- `06_LDA_Content Based.ipynb`

> If I liked *baked winter squash*, the model would recommend *outback croutons*, because the model found some categories that both recipes share.
